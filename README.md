# **Watch & Write**

## Code Institute Portfolio Project 4 - a Full Stack website using the Django framework and a database

# **Table of Contents**


# **Scope**
The project is meant to showcase my skills as a developer using the Python Django Framework. The website will function as a review site for people who are passionate about movies.
<br><br>
The project will use the Django AllAuth library to allow users to create accounts and log in to the website. Once they have logged in, users will be able to post reviews of movies to help other users to find worth while movies to watch. Logged-in users will also be able to like these reviews, and post comments. Users will be able to update and delete their own reviews.
<br><br>
The project will also feature several mechanisms for searching, sorting and filtering database entries.
<br><br>

# **Background**
This project was inspired by the fact that I can never decide what movie to watch and would need more data to make better decisions in my movie selecting.
<br>
<br>
[This is the repository](https://github.com/Linber93/watch_and_write)
<br>
<br>
[this is the deployed site on Heroku](https://watch-and-write.herokuapp.com/)
<br>
<br>
In the time we live in with the amount of streaming services and amount of movies available it is harder than ever to find good movies. this website provides a little more data to find good movies
